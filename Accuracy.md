## Uniqueness 
  - Accuracy refers to the accuracy of the data values based on the agreed-upon “source of truth.” Since numerous sources may report on the same measure, it’s critical that the company identify a primary data source for data accuracy. You can also use additional data sources to corroborate the primary one’s accuracy. To boost confidence in data accuracy, technologies can determine if each data source is moving in the same direction.
